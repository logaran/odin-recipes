    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 medium potatoes <span>peeled and thinly sliced</span></li>
        <li>1 onion <span>finely chopped</span></li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt <span>or to taste</span></li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper <span>or to taste</span></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and thinly slice the potatoes, and finely chop the onion.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced potatoes and cook until they are tender but not browned, stirring occasionally. This should take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the potatoes from the pan and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the eggs and season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked potatoes and chopped onion to the beaten eggs, and mix well to combine.</li>
        <li>Heat a small amount of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg, potato, and onion mixture into the pan and spread it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Cook the tortilla until it's set around the edges and the center is still slightly runny, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place a large plate over the pan and carefully flip the tortilla onto the plate.</li>
        <li>Slide the tortilla back into the pan and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes, or until it's completely set and golden brown on both sides.</li>
        <li>Remove the tortilla from the pan and let it cool slightly before cutting it into wedges.</li>
        <li>Serve your Spanish tortilla warm or at room temperature, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
